This is me. I was born in Ipoh, Perak, Malaysia, where I spent my childhood and completed my primary education at SJK(C) Gunning Rapat and my secondary education at Poi Lam High School (SUWA). Growing up in this vibrant town sparked my curiosity about science and the world around me, laying the foundation for everything that followed.

After finishing school, I moved to Kuching, Sarawak, Malaysia, where I pursued a Bachelor’s degree in Biotechnology at Swinburne University of Technology. I graduated with honors, achieving a CGPA of 3.71. This was a significant chapter of my life, where I began to truly delve into the world of science and research, expanding my knowledge and skills. During this time, I met many friends and lovely lecturers, with whom I still keep in contact. Among them, I met Dr. Daniel Tan Lee Tung, my FYP supervisor, who encouraged me to pursue my Master’s studies, leading to the next chapter of my academic journey. He also became my co-supervisor during my Master’s study.

While awaiting my Master’s studies in China, I worked as a Product Development Executive at Soon Soon Oilmills Sdn. Bhd. in Penang, Malaysia. This was my first time bridging the gap between academia and real-world applications, gaining valuable hands-on industry experience that would later shape my approach to research and innovation. I am deeply grateful to my supervisor, Dr. Wong Yong Chen, and my manager, Mr. Liew Wei Cheng, who taught me the basics of research and trend analysis to identify niche markets for organic products and streamline operations. They provided me with the opportunity to grow from having little knowledge to gaining practical experience in new areas. Their encouragement to continue my studies while I had the chance meant a lot to me. I would also like to thank my lovely colleagues in the product development department for their constant support and for creating a cheerful environment to work in. It was truly a very interesting and memorable experience for me.

My academic journey took a new turn when I moved to China to pursue a Master's degree in Environmental Engineering at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. The first year was spent attending courses in Beijing, where I achieved a CGPA of 3.96, followed by two years of research at the Institute of Urban Environment in Xiamen. This experience allowed me to grow not only as a researcher but also gave me a lot of exposure to global collaborators in China, Malaysia, and Indonesia. This stage of my journey deepened my passion for environmental research and further fuelled my desire to make a real-world impact through science.
