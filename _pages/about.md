This is me. I was born in Ipoh, Perak, Malaysia, where I spent my childhood and completed my primary education at SJK(C) Gunning Rapat and my secondary education at Poi Lam High School (SUWA). Growing up in this vibrant town sparked my curiosity about science and the world around me, laying the foundation for everything that followed.

After finishing school, I moved to Kuching, Sarawak, Malaysia, where I pursued a Bachelor’s degree in Biotechnology at Swinburne University of Technology. I graduated with honors, achieving a CGPA of 3.71. This was a significant chapter of my life, where I began to truly delve into the world of science and research, expanding my knowledge and skills. During this time, I met many friends and lovely lecturers, with whom I still keep in contact. Among them, I met Dr. Daniel Tan Lee Tung, my FYP supervisor, who encouraged me to pursue my Master’s studies, leading to the next chapter of my academic journey. He also became my co-supervisor during my Master’s study.

My academic journey took a new turn when I moved to China to pursue a Master's degree in Environmental Engineering at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. The first year was spent attending courses in Beijing, where I achieved a CGPA of 3.96, followed by two years of research at the Institute of Urban Environment in Xiamen. This experience allowed me to grow not only as a researcher but also gave me a lot of exposure to global collaborators in China, Malaysia, and Indonesia. This stage of my journey deepened my passion for environmental research and further fuelled my desire to make a real-world impact through science.

I graduated in July 2025, concluding my formal studies. This experience fueled my passion for transforming research ideas into practical solutions, and I am now looking forward to exploring new opportunities and challenges in the future.
