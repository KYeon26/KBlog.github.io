## Bachelor of Biotechnology
**Swinburne University of Technology, Sarawak (SUTS), Kuching, Malaysia** **(2019 - 2022)**
CGPA: 3.71




### Key Achievements:

### 1. Innovate Sarawak Design Challenge 2021
**Project Title: Predicting SARS-CoV-2 Inhibitors Using Machine Learning**

In 2021, I led a team of three in the Innovate Sarawak Design Challenge, where we focused on predicting SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors using machine learning. We employed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dataset preparation and trained protein kinase models, which were deployed on the DrugBank dataset to predict potential inhibitors. Our team utilized Microsoft Azure for model deployment and computational support. Our innovative approach earned us the First Prize in the AI Track and the Overall Excellent Award, which was a proud moment for our team.

### 2. 8th International Biotechnology Competition and Exhibition 2022
**Project Title: Innovative Green Method for Enhancing the Production of Agarwood Oil**

In April 2022, I presented my individual project at the 8th International Biotechnology Competition, which was also my Final Year Project for my Bachelor's degree. My project explored various pre-treatment techniques (chemical, enzymatic, and combined) on Agarwood bole plant parts and proposed an innovative green method to improve both the yield and quality of Agarwood oil. This work earned me a Bronze Award in the Innovate Product Presentation Category (Green Technology).
