## Bachelor of Biotechnology
**Swinburne University of Technology, Sarawak (SUTS), Kuching, Malaysia**
*2019 - 2022*
**CGPA: 3.71**

During my time at Swinburne University of Technology, I pursued my Bachelor of Biotechnology and graduated with honors, achieving a CGPA of 3.71. I was consistently on the Dean's List and had the opportunity to apply my knowledge in exciting real-world challenges.

### Key Achievements:

#### Innovate Sarawak Design Challenge 2021
**Project Title: Predicting SARS-CoV-2 Inhibitors Using Machine Learning**

In 2021, I led a team of three in the Innovate Sarawak Design Challenge, where we focused on predicting SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors using machine learning. We employed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dataset preparation and trained protein kinase models, which were deployed on the DrugBank dataset to predict potential inhibitors. Our team utilized Microsoft Azure for model deployment and computational support. Our innovative approach earned us the First Prize in the AI Track and the Overall Excellent Award, which was a proud moment for our team.

#### 8th International Biotechnology Competition and Exhibition 2022
**Project Title: Innovative Green Method for Enhancing the Production of Agarwood Oil**

In April 2022, I presented my individual project at the 8th International Biotechnology Competition, which was also my Final Year Project for my Bachelor's degree. My project explored various pre-treatment techniques (chemical, enzymatic, and combined) on Agarwood bole plant parts and proposed an innovative green method to improve both the yield and quality of Agarwood oil. This work earned me a Bronze Award in the Innovate Product Presentation Category (Green Technology).

## Master of Engineering in Environmental Engineering
**University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China**
*September 2022 – July 2025*
**CGPA: 3.96**

**ANSO Scholarship for Young Talents** – Awarded by the Alliance of International Science Organizations (ANSO) to support exceptional global talents in postgraduate studies in China.

During my Master’s studies at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, I focused on utilizing Malaysian biomass waste for biochar production to address agricultural challenges in paddy fields. My research involved evaluating a variety of feedstocks, including oil palm (mesocarp fiber, kernel shell, empty fruit bunch), sago (pith, bark, fine and coarse fiber), and coconut (shell, fiber).

*   Conducted a comparative study of nine biomass feedstocks for biochar production.
*   Performed thermogravimetric analysis to optimize temperature profiles for maximum biochar yield and quality.
*   Led soil amendment trials in greenhouse and paddy fields to evaluate the impact of biochar on soil health, crop growth, and yield.
