  This study investigates the pyrolysis characteristics of underutilized Malaysian biomass materials- palm mesocarp fiber (PMF), sago fiber coarse (SFC), and sago trunk bark (STB), and their potential to enhance soil fertility through biochar. The findings highlight the advantages of PMF-derived biochar, particularly when pyrolyzed at 500°C, in improving soil nutrient retention, promoting paddy yield, and contributing to long-term carbon sequestration.

  Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is a normal biological process where cellular contents are transported into the cells which is often hijacked by different viruses to enter host cells and cause infections. This study proposes two proteins that regulate clathrin-mediated endocytosis – AAK1 and GAK – as potential therapeutic targets for designing broad-spectrum antiviral drugs.
