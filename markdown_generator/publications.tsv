2025-05-08	Study of the pyrolysis characteristics and soil amendment potential of palm mesocarp fiber, sago fiber coarse, and sago trunk bark in Malaysia	Journal of Soils and Sediments	This study investigates the pyrolysis characteristics of underutilized Malaysian biomass materials- palm mesocarp fiber (PMF), sago fiber coarse (SFC), and sago trunk bark (STB), and their potential to enhance soil fertility through biochar. The findings highlight the advantages of PMF-derived biochar, particularly when pyrolyzed at 500°C, in improving soil nutrient retention, promoting paddy yield, and contributing to long-term carbon sequestration.

This study proposes two proteins that regulate clathrin-mediated endocytosis – AAK1 and GAK – as potential therapeutic targets for designing broad-spectrum antiviral drugs.
