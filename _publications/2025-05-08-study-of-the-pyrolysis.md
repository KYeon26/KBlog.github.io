title: "Study of the pyrolysis characteristics and soil amendment potential of palm mesocarp fiber, sago fiber coarse, and sago trunk bark in Malaysia"
collection: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/2025-05-08-study-of-the-pyrolysis
excerpt: 'This study investigates the pyrolysis characteristics of underutilized Malaysian biomass materials- palm mesocarp fiber (PMF), sago fiber coarse (SFC), and sago trunk bark (STB), and their potential to enhance soil fertility through biochar. The findings highlight the advantages of PMF-derived biochar, particularly when pyrolyzed at 500°C, in improving soil nutrient retention, promoting paddy yield, and contributing to long-term carbon sequestration.'
