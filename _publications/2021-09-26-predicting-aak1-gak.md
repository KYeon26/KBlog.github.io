excerpt: 'Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is a normal biological process where cellular contents are transported into the cells which is often hijacked by different viruses to enter host cells and cause infections. This study proposes two proteins that regulate clathrin-mediated endocytosis – AAK1 and GAK – as potential therapeutic targets for designing broad-spectrum antiviral drugs.'

Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is a normal biological process where cellular contents are transported into the cells which is often hijacked by different viruses to enter host cells and cause infections. This study proposes two proteins that regulate clathrin-mediated endocytosis – AAK1 and GAK – as potential therapeutic targets for designing broad-spectrum antiviral drugs.
