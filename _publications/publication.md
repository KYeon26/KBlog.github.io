### 1. Study of the pyrolysis characteristics and soil amendment potential of palm mesocarp fiber, sago fiber coarse, and sago trunk bark in Malaysia
- Journal of Soils and Sediments · May 8, 2025

This study investigates the pyrolysis characteristics of underutilized Malaysian biomass materials—palm mesocarp fiber (PMF), sago fiber coarse (SFC), and sago trunk bark (STB)—and their potential to enhance soil fertility through biochar. The findings highlight the advantages of PMF-derived biochar, particularly when pyrolyzed at 500°C, in improving soil nutrient retention, promoting paddy yield, and contributing to long-term carbon sequestration.


### 2. Predicting AAK1/GAK Dual-Target Inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 Viral Entry into Host Cells: An in silico Approach
- Penerbit UTM Press · Sep 26, 2021

Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is a normal biological process where cellular contents are transported into the cells which is often hijacked by different viruses to enter host cells and cause infections. This study proposes two proteins that regulate clathrin-mediated endocytosis – AAK1 and GAK – as potential therapeutic targets for designing broad-spectrum antiviral drugs.
